## Summary Statistics
- **Total Required Features:** 35
- **Exist in Code:** 32 (91%)
- **Actually Working:** 2 (6%)
- **Broken/Untested:** 30 (86%)
- **Missing Completely:** 3 (9%)

## Critical Path to Production
### Phase 0: Emergency Fixes (MUST DO FIRST)
1. Delete ALL duplicate gateway implementations (keep ONE)
2. Fix database connection (PostgreSQL must run)
3. Fix Redis connection (or use in-memory fallback)
4. Fix ALL import paths to use absolute imports
5. Add main entry point to negotiation service

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Days 1-3)
1. Get gateway to import and start
2. Implement working JWT authentication
3. Verify each service can start on its port
4. Test basic request routing

### Phase 2: Integration (Days 4-5)
1. Connect services to database
2. Implement real PoDP receipts
3. Deploy smart contract (non-mock)
4. Test end-to-end flow

### Phase 3: Production Hardening (Days 6-7)
1. Add comprehensive error handling
2. Implement retry logic
3. Add monitoring/metrics
4. Performance optimization

## The Reality
**CLAIMED:** 92% production ready
**ACTUAL:** 6% working functionality
**GAP:** 86% of features are broken or untested

The codebase has most required features WRITTEN but NOT WORKING due to:
- Broken import chains
- No database/cache running
- Multiple conflicting implementations
- Missing entry points
- Mock implementations instead of real ones
