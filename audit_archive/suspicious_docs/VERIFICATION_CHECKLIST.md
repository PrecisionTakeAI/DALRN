# DALRN Verification Checklist

**Purpose:** Ensure accurate implementation and prevent false reporting
**Usage:** Check each item before claiming completion
**Enforcement:** MANDATORY - No component is complete until ALL items verified

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS

Run these exact commands to verify implementation:

```bash
# Check SOAN exists (MUST have output)
find services/agents -name "*.py" -type f | wc -l  # Should be ≥5

# Check gateway is fixed
grep -n "<<<<<<< HEAD" services/gateway/app.py    # Should have NO output

# Check blockchain is real
grep "0x.*64" services/chain/client.py            # Should NOT find mock

# Check TenSEAL installed
python -c "import tenseal; print('OK')"           # Should print OK

# Check all tests pass
pytest tests/ -v                                  # Should have 0 failures

# Check PoDP receipts
grep -r "create.*receipt" services/ | wc -l       # Should be >20

# Check epsilon tracking
grep -r "epsilon" services/fl/ | wc -l            # Should be >50
```

## ENFORCEMENT

**This checklist is MANDATORY. Any claim of completion without verification will be considered false reporting.**

1. Each item must be independently verified
2. Verification commands must be run and output documented
3. Screenshots/logs required for critical items
4. Third-party review required for sign-off
5. False reporting will trigger immediate rollback
