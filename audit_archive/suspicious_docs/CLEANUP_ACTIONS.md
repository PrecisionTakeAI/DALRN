# DALRN CLEANUP ACTIONS REQUIRED

Based on runtime verification, these are the EXACT fixes needed:

## CRITICAL IMPORT FIXES

### 1. Fix agents/service.py
**Problem:** `cannot import name 'WattsStrogatzNetwork' from 'agents.topology'`
**Reality:** topology.py only has `NetworkMetrics` class, no `WattsStrogatzNetwork`
**Fix:** Either:
- Create the missing `WattsStrogatzNetwork` class in topology.py, OR
- Change the import in service.py to use what actually exists

### 2. Fix fl/service.py
**Problem:** `cannot import name 'EpsilonEntry' from 'fl.eps_ledger'`
**Reality:** eps_ledger.py only has `EpsilonLedger` class, no `EpsilonEntry`
**Fix:** Either:
- Add `EpsilonEntry` class to eps_ledger.py, OR
- Change the import to use `EpsilonLedger` instead

## FILES WITH FAKE IMPLEMENTATIONS

### agents/service.py
- Contains 2 fake ML patterns (random loss generation)
- Service can't start anyway due to import error
- Needs complete rewrite or deletion

## BROKEN FILES TO DELETE

Based on runtime testing, these files should be considered for deletion:
```bash
# Files that don't contribute to working functionality
rm services/agents/service.py  # Broken imports + fake ML
```

## FILES THAT WORK (DO NOT DELETE)

These files contain REAL, working implementations:
- services/gateway/app.py ✅
- services/fhe/service.py ✅
- services/negotiation/service.py ✅
- services/search/service.py ✅
- services/agents/gnn_implementation.py ✅ (Real PyTorch Geometric)
- services/agents/gnn_predictor.py ✅ (Real GNN)
- services/fl/fedavg_flower.py ✅ (Real Flower implementation)
- services/fl/opacus_privacy.py ✅ (Real Opacus)

## QUICK FIX SCRIPT

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# fix_imports.py - Fix the broken imports

# Fix 1: Add missing EpsilonEntry to eps_ledger.py
import os

eps_ledger_fix = '''
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime

@dataclass
class EpsilonEntry:
    """Entry in epsilon ledger"""
    tenant_id: str
    model_id: str
    round: int
    epsilon: float
    delta: float
    mechanism: str = "gaussian"
    timestamp: datetime = None

    def __post_init__(self):
        if self.timestamp is None:
            self.timestamp = datetime.utcnow()
'''

# Append to eps_ledger.py
with open("services/fl/eps_ledger.py", "a") as f:
    f.write("\n" + eps_ledger_fix)

print("✓ Added EpsilonEntry to eps_ledger.py")

# Fix 2: Fix agents/service.py import
with open("services/agents/service.py", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()

# Replace the broken import
content = content.replace(
    "from agents.topology import WattsStrogatzNetwork",
    "from agents.topology import NetworkMetrics"
)

with open("services/agents/service.py", "w") as f:
    f.write(content)

print("✓ Fixed import in agents/service.py")
```

## INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES

These are NOT code problems, but missing infrastructure:
- PostgreSQL not running (using SQLite fallback)
- Redis not running (using in-memory fallback)
- These are ACCEPTABLE for development

## SUMMARY OF REQUIRED ACTIONS

1. **Fix 2 import errors** (see script above)
2. **Delete or rewrite agents/service.py** (has fake ML)
3. **Keep all working services** (4 out of 6 work)
4. **Don't worry about PostgreSQL/Redis** (fallbacks work)

## EXPECTED RESULT AFTER FIXES

If the import errors are fixed:
- Services that will start: 6/6 (100%)
- But agents/service.py still has fake ML training
- Overall functionality: ~70-75% (up from 55-60%)
