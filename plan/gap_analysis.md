## Conclusion

The DALRN codebase shows strong implementation of privacy-preserving technologies with excellent quality in FHE and FL/Privacy services. The Gateway provides solid orchestration, and the blockchain integration is well-designed. However, the complete absence of Self-Organizing Agent Networks represents a critical gap that must be addressed immediately.

With focused development effort on the identified gaps, particularly the agent networks and negotiation service enhancements, the system can achieve production readiness within 8 weeks. The existing high-quality implementations provide a strong foundation for completing the remaining features.

**Overall Implementation Score: 75%**  
**Production Readiness: 60%**  
**Estimated Time to Production: 8 weeks**
